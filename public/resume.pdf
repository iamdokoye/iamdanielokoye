# Placeholder Resume File

This is a placeholder for Daniel Okoye's resume. In a real implementation, this would be a PDF file containing the resume.

To replace this with an actual resume:
1. Create a professional PDF resume
2. Replace this file with the actual PDF
3. Ensure the file is named "resume.pdf" and placed in the public folder

The download button in the header will then link to this file.
